I have always been interested in coding. Ever since I was making backgrounds and changing the layout of my MySpace accounts. Of course back then I had no idea I was coding. Adding a little "</br>" line break here or there. Or manually creating a slideshow did not seem that difficult back then. Just knew I wanted my page to look extra "poppin"

When I went to college, I thought I had everything figured out. I would graduate a business major. Do something in business, get rich, be happy. . . RIGHT? Well WRONG, of course. I was miserable and caught myself missing the challenges associated with coding. I went to work and realized how tedious the work is and how different I was from everyone else at my job who felt that this was it. 

I took a part time web development course with New York Coding and Design Academy and although my teacher was AMAZING! The school was not very helpful with resources. They did not provide you with any real tools on how to get a job after completing the course. I made some amazing coding freinds but as for a career. . . I was still stuck in finance. 

Flash forward to today and I finally decided to put my money towards my future again with Flatiron Academy. I am hoping to apply my past learnings as well as learn more to build my portfolio up and get a job as a Software Engineer finally. Let see how this ends. . . .
