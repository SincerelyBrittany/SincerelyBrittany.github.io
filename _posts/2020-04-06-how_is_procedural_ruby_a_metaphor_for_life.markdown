The assignment today is to explain How is Procedural Ruby a metaphor for life?

I guess the first thing one should ask themselves is . . . WHAT ON EARTH IS PROCEDURAL RUBY.

I have been going through the Online Software Engineering part time course with Flatiron school and a few things I picked up on is that apparently. . .

Procedural programming, involves having data and procedures or instructions for operating on that data. In procedural programming, data and procedures, or instructions, are two separate things.

So how is that a metaphor for life? I think in life we are given the tools we need to be successful in life. However, without direction we will not know where or how to use the tools accessible to us.

Having the tools then having a guideline on how to use the tools to be successful is defintely a metaphor for every day life.
