So when this first started I made a deal to myself that I would code every day. 

Well the joke is on me. I found myself behind as LIFE got the best of me. 

I got a call from my mother informing me that my GODFather past away and that we would have to go to Florida for the funeral the following week. Mind you, this was all during the outbreak of this whole COVID19 virus that everyone is talking about. So while mourning and freaking about a virus, I slowly found myself letting goal of my coding every day goal I made for myself and found myself behind on my Flatiron studies. 

I caught myself talking to myself and trying to motivate myself to keep going and stay motivated as life proved to come hard at me. 

I refuse to give up and instead decided to take it slow. One project, one code, one day at a time. 

Some things that has helped me: 

1. Short-term goals. -- instead of making sure I code every day. I make sure I do something towards coding -- including watching a youtube video instead or just reading.

2. Be extremely optimistic. -- AFFIRMATIONS - Keep telling myself I can do this and talk in the mirror -- make the people are are still with me and no longer with me PROUD

3. Surround yourself with like-minded people. -- I have an amazing cohort team that I write to on slack and they always give me the optimistic push I need. I have learned that I may feel alone but I am never alone. People are behind like me and willing to help at all times. 

4.  Commit to the end goal. -- See this to the end. It is something I always wanted and I know that one day I am going to read this blog post and laugh at ever doubting myself.
